## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
 
* Updated the DESCRIPTION title to use single quotes for 'INVEKOS'.
* Updated the DESCRIPTION description to use single quotes for 'shiny' and 'INVEKOS'.
* Added a web reference for the INVEKOS API in the DESCRIPTION.

I have tested the package on multiple platforms and verified that all checks pass with `devtools::check()`.





## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note
